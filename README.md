This article talks about the open source model used for software development and the benefits it serves to the tech industry. It argues that open-source designs are beneficial for both economic and geopolitical reasons. The fact that the technology is public prevents companies from monopolizing the industry and promotes competition. The article notes that the open source model is now being applies to hardware design as well, for instance the RISK-V chips which are built based on open-source designs and are attracting attention and investment from major stakeholders across the world. Furthermore, in a highly polarized political environment such as today, the open source model prevents isolation of companies and developers anywhere in the world. For example, after the United States blacklisted Chinese company Huawei’s products, China has set a new goal for itself to develop most software internally reducing dependence on foreign proprietary software. Moreover, proprietary software in the hands of autocratic governments jeopardizes users’ privacy and safety. Therefore, the open-source development model eliminates the concern for such unhealthy business practices by simply making access to technology public.
